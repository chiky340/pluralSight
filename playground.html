                  Value with Pluralsight reaches across the board for us. On one
                  project alone, we saved over 20,000£ over more traditional
                  training courses,” says Graham Dalton, VP of Product
                  Development. “Even more importantly than the cost savings is
                  our ability to scale it across the business.”
